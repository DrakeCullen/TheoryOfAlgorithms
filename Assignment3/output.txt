The following hash tables are created with variable occupancy rates. They are than used to look up 1,530 random words 5,000 times. 
Therefore, there are a total of 7,650,000 lookups. The number of clock ticks and time in seconds are reported. 

An occupancy rate of 0.1 took 1056214 clock ticks and 1.05611 seconds for 7,650,000 lookups. 
There are 405 collisions.

An occupancy rate of 0.5 took 1059467 clock ticks and 1.05936 seconds for 7,650,000 lookups. 
There are 1650 collisions.

An occupancy rate of 0.7 took 1076869 clock ticks and 1.07679 seconds for 7,650,000 lookups. 
There are 1898 collisions.

An occupancy rate of 0.8 took 1087914 clock ticks and 1.08783 seconds for 7,650,000 lookups. 
There are 2049 collisions.
