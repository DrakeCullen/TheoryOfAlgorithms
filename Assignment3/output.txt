The following hash tables are created with variable occupancy rates. They are than used to look up 1,530 random words 5,000 times. 
Therefore, there are a total of 7,650,000 lookups. The number of clock ticks and time in seconds are reported. 

An occupancy rate of 0.5 took 1072580 clock ticks and 1.07223 seconds for 7,650,000 lookups. 
There are 1650 collisions.

An occupancy rate of 0.7 took 1091944 clock ticks and 1.09161 seconds for 7,650,000 lookups. 
There are 1898 collisions.

An occupancy rate of 0.8 took 1122989 clock ticks and 1.12264 seconds for 7,650,000 lookups. 
There are 2049 collisions.
