\section*{Statement a)}
I tested my hashtable with occupancy ratios of 50\%, 70\%, and 80\%. For each occupancy ratio, 7,650,000 lookups were performed with random words so that a discernable time difference could be found. \newline The occupancy ratio of 50\% took 1,072,580 clock cycles and 1.07223 seconds to perform the lookups. There were 1,650 collisions. \newline The occupancy ratio of 70\% took 1,091,944 clock cycles and 1.09161 seconds to perform the lookups. There were 1,898 collisions. \newline The occupancy ratio of 80\% took 1,0122,989 clock cycles and 1.12265 seconds to perform the lookups. There were 2,049 collisions. \newline I decided to use an occupancy ratio of 50\% for the rest of my experiments.


\section*{Statement b)}
I used open hashing, so my hash table could handle variable sizes by adding new elements to the linked list.

\section*{Statement c)}
I started off with the hash function f(r) = r \% hsize. Next, I incorporated the following hash function from our slides:

\end{center}

In order to minimize collisions, I created a set of nested loops to change the initial val to numbers in the range from 0 to 10,000. Every time I changed the initial value, the bit shifting variable looped through values of 0 to 25. In the end, I found an initial value of 530 with a left shift of 8 minimized the number of collisions.

\section*{Statement d)}
If there is a collision, I iterate over the corresponding linked list and insert the new word in alphabetical order.

\section*{Statement e)}
No, you don't need an interface class for each function. I put my hashtable in a class, so I did use an interface class for the hashtable methods.
