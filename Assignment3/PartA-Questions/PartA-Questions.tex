\section{Statement a)}
The statement is \textbf{True}. Start by finding the weight with the minimum value (smallest negative value). Add a constant factor large enough to make that value positive, and add that value to every other weight. Now, every weight is a positive value. We know that Dijkstras algorithm can be run on graphs with all positive values.

\newpage
\section{Statement b)}
The statement is \textbf{False}. Weights with a value of one cause a problem. Other positive integers will grow larger when squared, but one will keep the same value when squared; therefore, the weights won't increase proportionally. The statement would be true if every weight was multiplied by a constant such as 2. The manner in which the statement fails can be seen in the example below.
